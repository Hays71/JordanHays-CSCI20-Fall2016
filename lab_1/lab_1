Electrical Engineering
Required lower division for my major 
I dont expect to become a master in any programming language, however I do expect to become proficient enough to be able to talk to anyone about programming and understand the language and be able to perform programming functions on a beginner to moderate level
I have not practiced programming of any kind for almost 4 years so I consider myself very beginner and it does concern me about my succes in this course
